# first, we download the xz file for the python version we want
wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/PYTHONVERSIONNR/PYTHONVERSION.tar.xz

# second, we untar the xz file. this will install a folder in our home directory
tar -Jxf PYTHONVERSION.tar.xz

# we cd into the folder
cd PYTHONVERSION/

# and now, we run the configure script, which builds a make file
# note our options. we want the interpreter optimized to run on our hardware, and
# we want it installed in our home directory

# i recommend isolating this python instance
# if you need to scratch this deployment of python
# and start over, isolation in its own directory
# makes cleaning up and starting over easier
./configure --enable-optimizations --prefix=$HOME/.localPython

# the -j option for the make command allows us to specify how many cores we want to commit to the compilation and linking
make -j4
make install

# in $HOME/.localPython/bin, create symbolic links
ln -s python3 python
ln -s pip3 pip

# in .bashrc file, add these lines to the top of the file:
PATH="$HOME/.localPython/bin:$PATH"

# afterwards, source the file
source .bashrc
